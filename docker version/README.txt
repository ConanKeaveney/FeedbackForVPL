This directory contains all the files necessary to run the dockerized moodle instance. If you are having trouble running this instance, the non-dockerized version is also available.
The VPL plugin can be downloaded from the following site: https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_vpl. The zip is moved to the "mod" directory in Moodle.

This instance is based on the bitnami docker image for Moodle available here : https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-moodle
