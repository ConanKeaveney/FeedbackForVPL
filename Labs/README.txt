This directory contains the all work revolving around the custom lab grading: 
In this directory is a bank of c++ questions that could be issued to students within the VPL environment. 
The code that you want to give to the student to work with can be added to the "requested files" section of VPL lab. 
In order to add custom evaluation to the lab, it is required to write custom evaluation and run scripts, that are then added to the "Execution files" section within a VPL activity.
Any header files can be added to the "Execution files" section awithin VPL activity also. 
Templates for these files have been created for this project and are located in the "Run and Evaluate Scripts" directory. If you want to search for a particular data structure in the lab code, there is a regex table that can also be referenced in the "Regex" directory. 
An example of a lab question with custom evaluation can be seen in lab 2 exercise 4. 
This has custom scripts that can be added to the VPL activity to allow for custom grading and comments.
